I still remember the excitement I had 15 years ago when I discovered my first
**programming advent calendar**; it was one about
[Perl](http://perladvent.org/2000/). It was awesome, and every year, I was
waiting for another series of blog posts about great Perl modules. When I
open-sourced [symfony1](http://symfony.com/legacy), I knew that writing an
advent calendar would help adoption;
[Askeet](http://symfony.com/legacy/doc/askeet/1_0) was indeed a great success
and the first advent calendar I was heavily involved with. I wrote another one,
[Jobeet](http://symfony.com/legacy/doc/jobeet?orm=Propel), for symfony 1.4 some
years later.

And today, I'm very happy to announce my third advent calendar, this one is
about [Blackfire](https://blackfire.io/). This time, the goal is different
though: in this series, I won't write an application, but instead, I'm going to
look at some **development best practices** which includes topics like
profiling, performance, testing, continuous integration, and my vision on
performance optimization best practices.

I won't reveal more about the content of the 24 days as the point is for you to
discover a new chapter day after day, but I can already tell you that I have
some great presents for you... just one small clue: it's about Open-Sourcing
something. I'm going to stop this blog post now before I tell you too much!

Enjoy the [first installment](https://blackfire.io/24-days) for now as it has
just been published.
