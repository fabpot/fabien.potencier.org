This has been an amazing week for me,
[Symfony](http://www.symfony-project.org/), and the whole Symfony community.
With more than 350 attendees coming from more than 30 countries, the Symfony
Live [conference](http://www.symfony-live.com/) was a blast. I want to thank
all attendees, speakers, and the [Sensio Labs](http://www.sensiolabs.com/)
team for coming to the conference and making it a truly fantastic event.

If you have not attended the conference, you can still come to the Symfony
Live
[After-Party](http://www.meetup.com/London-events-by-Boxlight-Media/calendar/12416585/)
next week in London. And don't miss Symfony
[Camp](http://www.symfonycamp.com/) in June and Symfony
[Day](http://www.symfonyday.com/en/) in October. If you live far away from
Europe, stay tuned as we have more exciting news to announce in the coming
weeks.

The conference was also the occasion to unveil the first preview release of
the upcoming [Symfony 2](http://www.symfony-reloaded.org/) framework. Since
then, the buzz has been great and I have already received a lot of good
comments on it. Of course, I hope that this is just the beginning, and that
more people will provide feedback.

On the PHP Community
--------------------

I'm also very proud that people from so many different PHP "sub-communities"
attended the conference: Jon Wage (Doctrine project manager and lead developer of Doctrine 1.x), Fran√ßois
Zaninotto (lead developer of Propel), Nils Adermann (lead developer of PhpBB),
and of course, Matthew Weier O'Phinney (Zend Framework lead).

I like to see the whole PHP community as a big unified group of developers
trying to promote the same platform. And I do my best to be a good "PHP
citizen". I try to innovate by adapting concepts from other languages. But I
also try to not reinvent the wheel when it's not mandatory. The symfony 1
framework uses a lot of third-party libraries like Propel and Doctrine. And
for Symfony 2, I'm proud to have replaced our own Logger and Cache system by
the equivalent components from the Zend Framework. And you can imagine that it
was not an easy decision to take. First, because it meant throwing away code
we have written and maintained for years. Then, because the Zend Framework is
our main competitor. But I'm sure we have made the right decision and Matthew
seems to have the same 
[point of view](http://weierophinney.net/matthew/archives/232-Symfony-Live-2010.html)
 on that matter.

On PHP Frameworks
-----------------

People are jealous, so jealous that it makes me really sad. For the last few
years, some PHP framework communities attempted to "kill" Symfony by trying to
demonstrate that it is too slow, too complex, and too bloated. Of course,
that's not true. And the number of
[high](http://answers.yahoo.com/)-[traffic](http://delicious.com/)
[websites](http://www.dailymotion.com/) using symfony 1 speaks for us.

I get inspiration from many different frameworks from many different
languages. Besides PHP projects, I like to follow the development of Django,
Spring, Rails, Maven, Jinja, Rack, Sinatra, and many others. I try to bring
innovation to the table. And for Symfony 2, I have tried to take into account
the major pain points of symfony 1. The truth is that Symfony 2.0 requires no
configuration. The truth is that Symfony 2 is really fast. Is it the fastest
framework? I don't care. It is probably fast enough for your next website, and
so is symfony 1.

Now if some people cannot accept that Symfony 2 is really fast and if they
cannot accept that Symfony 2 is great step forward for PHP, that's sad. The
web evolves very fast. Competition is everywhere for PHP. We should all be in
the same boat.

I would love if people from different framework communities can work together
more often, like what we have done with the PHP 5.3 interoperability group. I
would love if we can share more components. I would love to discuss how we can
make our PHP community grow faster.

Is it a dream? I hope it's not. And I have a proposal. Let's organize an event
where several PHP framework communities can discuss and share ideas. Anyone?

On Dependency Injection
-----------------------

The biggest Symfony 2 innovation lies in its low level architecture. And its
flexibility and speed is mainly due to the Symfony Dependency Injection
Container component. Dependency Injection Containers are not widespread in the
PHP world, and I really think that this is a very good approach. That's why I
talk about Dependency Injection at conferences. Next time I will talk about
this topic is during the
[ConFoo](http://confoo.ca/en/2010/session/dependency-injection-in-php-5-2-and-5-3)
conference in March.
