This year, I traveled in 7 countries for PHP conferences, giving a total of 12
talks. It has been a very exiting year of conferences for me. I met old and
new friends, I learned a bunch of new things (not always related to PHP) and I
had of course very interesting conversations about PHP 5.3, symfony, Twig, the
Zend Framework, and various other topics.

In March, I went to the PHP Quebec conference. Three years ago, this was my
first PHP conference, and as such it's always a very special event for me.
This was also the first conference where I gave a talk about Symfony 2.

In May, I had the pleasure to go to the PHP Day in Italy. This was probably
one of the most convivial conference of the year. Italian people are very
friendly, and the food is always amazing.

In June, it was the first Symfony Live conference. I was one of the organizer,
and also a speaker of course. This was a great success and I had a wonderful
time talking with so many symfony users.

In September, I went to Japan for their 10th PHP conference. This was my first
time in Japan, and I'm eager to come back someday. This was also the first
time I worked with a professional translator.

In October, thanks to Zend, I went to the Zend PHP Conference in San Jose.
Needless to say that this was an amazing experience. I have also kind of
officially "launched" [Twig](http://www.twig-project.org/) at this conference,
and created [Pirum](http://www.pirum-project.org/) during a night thanks to
the [jetlag](http://twitter.com/fabpot/status/4969508481). This is also where
I decided that Symfony 2 would only support PHP 5.3. At the end of October, I
also went to the PHP Barcelona conference for the first time.

In November, after the Forum PHP conference in Paris, where I talked about PHP
5.3, my new friend, I went to the IPC conference in Karlsruhe. Two great
conferences, where I always meet a lot of friends.

Thanks to all conference organizers for giving me these great opportunities.

All my slides are available in the [talk](http://fabien.potencier.org/talks)
