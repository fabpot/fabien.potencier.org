Some people emailed me about a blog
[post](https://fabien.potencier.org/article/17/on-php-5-3-lambda-functions-and-closures)
I wrote some time ago about a dependency injection container done in PHP 5.3.
I have published on [Github](http://github.com/fabpot/twittee) the small
version of it ([Twittee](http://twittee.org/)), but not the "working" version.

Today, I took the time to publish it on
[Github](http://github.com/fabpot/Pimple). Pimple is a small dependency
injection container, with all the features you need for a usage in real
projects.

Feel free to use it, fork it, and enhance it for your next PHP 5.3 project.

And don't forget to give PHP 5.3 a try as the PHP core team has just
[published](http://www.php.net/archive/2009.php#id2009-06-12-1) the third
release candidate, and they hope to release the final version by the end of
June.
