As you might have noticed if you follow me on
[Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/fabpot), I'm the new project manager of
[Swift Mailer](https://www.swiftmailer.org/), a powerful mailing library for
PHP.

This is a great honor for me to take over such a project. The Swift Mailer
project has been initiated by Chris Corbyn some years ago. He has done a
wonderful job during the years, trying to find the best way to create a
top-notch emailing solution for PHP. With the release of the 4th version of
Swift Mailer earlier this year, I think we now have a very solid mailing
library. It is one of the most beautiful code I have had the pleasure to read.
Also, the library is feature-rich, object-oriented, and very modular thanks to
its plugin architecture. The good news is that Chris will still work on the
project, so the takeover will be smooth.

Unfortunately, it seems that Swift Mailer has not been as widespread as it
deserves to be. One of my goal is to spread the word about it, and of course,
if you are looking for a good solution to send emails, try it, you won't be
disappointed. It is already used by companies sending ten of thousands of
emails per hour!

As a good news never comes alone, as we say in France, Swift Mailer 4 will
also be supported as the default emailing solution as of symfony 1.3.

I also have lots of ideas to move the project forward. One of them is to
better support the intricacies of Japanese emails. Another one is to have
better documentation, and more people talking about the project.

Of course I need help. So, if you want to join a great Open-Source project,
visit the Swift Mailer website today, subscribe to the
[mailing-list](http://groups.google.com/group/swiftmailer), and help us build
a great PHP library!
