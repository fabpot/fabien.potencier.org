Some days ago, I started to use [twitter](http://twitter.com/fabpot). I am not sure how it will works for me, but I will try to do some experiments with it.

What can I do with 140 characters? A web framework? Done in PHP?

Enter Twitto. Twitto is the first framework done in a tweet. That's right. Twitto fits in a tweet.
Moreover, I have tried to use as much new PHP 5.3 features as possible.

Twitto even has its own [website](http://twitto.org/) and documentation.

Of course, this is just a toy and you should not use it as a serious tool.
