As a lead developer of Symfony, I need feedback. Symfony being an Open-Source
project, there is no way I can know how many people are using it, who they are
and what they do with it. That's fine and all, but sometimes, that would
really help me to know the Symfony user base a bit more. Sure enough, I have
some feedback via email and Twitter. Actually, I receive tons of
emails every single day about Symfony and my other Open-Source projects (with a raising number of Git pull requests... keep them
coming by the way). But unfortunately, most of them are from
people complaining about something or asking me some more free stuff. I must
admit that this is depressing.

During the Symfony Day conference last week, I suggested that people send me a
postcard if they use Symfony. The idea is not mine, as
[Derick](http://www.derickrethans.nl/xdebug-2-released.html) did the same a
couple of years ago for XDebug.

So, if you use Symfony and enjoy it, consider sending me a postcard. Tell me
why you are a Symfony user and what you do with it (if you're not comfortable with English, that's fine... I will also enjoy Japanese, Chinese, or Arabic postcards). You can send them to my
personal address:

    [REDACTED]

And I have a dream that one day I will receive a postcard each time a new
Symfony website is deployed to production.
