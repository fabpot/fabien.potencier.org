This was my first Zend Conference, and I must say I had a great time there.
The organization was top notch, there were plenty of good sessions, and the
unconference topics proved to be very interesting.

I've also met and talked with a lot of great people. I have particularly
enjoyed the talks I had with the Zend team, and with all the people I had
email conversations with in the past but never had the chance to meet in
person.

Beside my
[talk](http://www.slideshare.net/fabpot/symfony-and-zend-framework-together-2009)
about how to use symfony within a Zend Framework project, I have also held an
uncon session about
[Twig](http://www.slideshare.net/fabpot/twig-the-flexible-fast-and-securetemplate-language-for-php),
and took part in a roundtable about Dependency Injection.

If you have not attended Zend Con this year, most of the presentations are now
available online on both
[slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/tag/zendcon09?sort=views) and
[joind](http://joind.in/event/view/44).

Last but not the least, I have been invited yesterday by the San Francisco symfony user group to talk
about [Symfony 2](http://www.slideshare.net/fabpot/symfony2-san-francisco-meetup-2009),
and I had a great time talking with SF symfony users.

Thanks again Zend for inviting me this year, and I hope to come back next
year.
