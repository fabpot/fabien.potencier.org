I'm back from mostly six weeks of vacation. I really enjoyed being able to
drop my laptop and spent time doing non-computer related stuff. Everything has
to end, and as of today, I'm back to work... Well, mostly. I will travel a lot
during fall for business reasons, and also to speak at several conferences.

First, I'm really excited to have been invited to speak at the [10th Japan PHP conference](http://phpcon.php.gr.jp/2009/en/)
in Tokyo (4-5 September 2009). Being my first time there, I will speak about symfony of course, and how the framework
help developing professional websites.

Then, I will speak at the [Zend PHP Conference](http://zendcon.com/) (19-22
October 2009 - San Jose CA, USA). This will be the first time I attend
the Zend conference. I will talk about "Using Zend Framework and Symfony
Together" and will participate at the "Framework Shootout".

Towards the end of the year, I will speak at the [Forum PHP](http://afup.org/pages/forumphp2009/)
(12-13 November 2009 - Paris, France). This year, I will play with PHP 5.3 and show how to take
advantage of the language new features (this one will be in French).

To end this year of conferences, I will eventually speak at the
[International PHP Conference](http://it-republik.de/php/phpconference09/) (15-18 November 2009 - Karlsruhe, Germany),
where I will have two sessions: "Symfony Components: What's in for you?", and "Dependency Injection in PHP 5.2 and 5.3".

If you attend any of these conferences, stop by and let's talk a bit.
